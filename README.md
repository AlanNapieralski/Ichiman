# 🧠 Ichiman — A Calm, Consistent Path to Mastery

> _Ichiman (一万) means 10,000 in Japanese. Inspired by the “10,000-hour rule,” this app aims to help you reach mastery—quietly, mindfully, and sustainably._

---

## ⚠️ Still in Development

Ichiman is currently in active development. Many features—including the **ranking system**, **non-toxic social comparison**, and **smart consistency metrics**—are still being built. This README documents the philosophy and planned design of the app, as well as the progress so far.

## 🧭 Philosophy: No Streaks, No Burnout, Just Progress

Ichiman is **not just another time tracker**. It’s a tool for **meaningful, self-paced progress**—without pressure to show up every single day, without streaks, without guilt.

We don't reward obsessive daily grind. We reward **sustainable consistency**—the kind that leads to real growth without burnout.

Inspired by Malcolm Gladwell’s interpretation of the **10,000-hour rule**, Ichiman helps you track the time you've truly invested in a skill, not with meaningless gamification, but through **clear milestones**, **rank progression**, and **gentle accountability**.

## 🛠️ What Ichiman Does

### ⏱️ Simple Skill Timer

- Quick-select a skill from your saved list.
- Tap to begin tracking—no manual input needed.
- Use a **Pomodoro-style clock** to stay focused.
- When the clock ends, **all running timers automatically stop**.

### 🎯 Rank System (In Progress)

A transparent, motivating rank system to see your journey at a glance:

- **Bronze**: 0 hours  
- **Silver**: 100 hours  
- **Gold**: 500 hours  
- **Platinum**: 1,000 hours  
- **Diamond**: 5,000 hours  
- **Master**: 10,000 hours

Ranks update visually as you reach new milestones. Each skill tracks independently.

### 📊 Point System (In Progress)

Ichiman rewards your **commitment over time**, not streaks or pressure.

Earn points for:
- Hitting milestones (every 25% of a rank)
- Showing up consistently (e.g., spaced sessions over time)
- Maintaining balance (avoiding burnout by pacing yourself)

### 👥 Healthy Social Comparison (Planned)

- Compare progress with friends in a **non-toxic** way.
- No streaks. No shame. Just context.
- See how far you've come together—not how perfectly you perform daily.

## 🧩 UI & Design Overview

From the prototype:

- 🔧 **Skill Panel**: View and manage your tracked skills
- 🔽 **Dropdown Hierarchy**: Expand a general skill (e.g. "Programming") into sub-skills (e.g. "Python", "Rust")
- 🕒 **Timer & Clock UI**: One Pomodoro-style session timer that governs all ongoing recordings
- 🎖️ **Visual Rank Progression**: Skill bars change color as you climb ranks
- 📄 **Settings/Profile**: Access to preferences and user config

## 🔍 Why Ichiman?

Most productivity tools focus on “showing up every day.” While that’s fine in theory, it fails in practice. We all have life, interruptions, off-days—and **we shouldn’t be punished for that**.

Ichiman exists to support people who:

- Want to get better at something over the long term
- Hate the pressure of losing streaks
- Care more about **total time spent learning** than flashy badges
- Want to **feel** their progress—slowly but surely

---

## 📅 Upcoming Features

- [ ] Full authentication & profile syncing
- [ ] Real-time social skill comparison (private & friend groups)
- [ ] Mobile-first UI
- [ ] Exportable skill logs
- [ ] Custom time goals for skills (not just 10,000 hrs)
